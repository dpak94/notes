  Scaling in ML
  <a class="anchor" href="#scaling-in-ml">#</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Feature scaling</strong> is the process of normalizing the range of features in a dataset. Real-world datasets often contain features that are varying in degrees of magnitude, range, and units. Therefore, in order for machine learning models to interpret these features on the same scale, we need to perform feature scaling.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Scalar Functions :</strong>
A. MinMaxScalar() Function
B. StandardScaler Function
C. RobustScaler Function</p>
<h3 id="minmaxscaler-function">
  MinMaxScaler() Function
  <a class="anchor" href="#minmaxscaler-function">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Transform features by scaling each feature to a given range. This estimator scales and translates each feature individually such that it is in the given range on the training set, <strong>e.g.</strong> between zero and one.</p>
<p><strong>Scikit Learn Syntax :</strong> ==from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler==</p>
<h3 id="standardscaler-function">
  StandardScaler() Function
  <a class="anchor" href="#standardscaler-function">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Standardize features by removing the <strong>mean</strong> and scaling to <strong>unit variance</strong>. The standard score of a sample x is calculated as:</p>
<p>$$
z = (x - u) / s
$$</p>
<p><strong>Scikit Learn Syntax :</strong> ==from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler==</p>
<h3 id="robustscaler-function">
  RobustScaler Function
  <a class="anchor" href="#robustscaler-function">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Scale features using statistics that are robust to outliers.</p>
<p>This Scaler removes the median and scales the data according to the quantile range (defaults to <strong>IQR: Interquartile Range</strong>). The IQR is the range between the 1st quartile (25th quantile) and the 3rd quartile (75th quantile).</p>
<p>Centering and scaling happen independently on each feature by computing the relevant statistics on the samples in the training set. Median and interquartile range are then stored to be used on later data using the transform method.</p>
<p>Standardization of a dataset is a common requirement for many machine learning estimators. Typically this is done by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. However, outliers can often influence the sample mean / variance in a negative way. In such cases, the median and the interquartile range often give better results.</p>

<h3 id="bagging-method">
  Bagging Method
  <a class="anchor" href="#bagging-method">#</a>
</h3>
<p>In this method, a random sample of data in a training set is selected with replacement—meaning that the individual data points can be chosen more than once. After several data samples are generated, these models are then trained independently, and depending on the type of task—i.e. regression or classification—the average or majority of those predictions yield a more accurate estimate.</p>
<p>This approach is commonly used to reduce variance within a noisy dataset.</p>
<h3 id="random-forest-method">
  Random Forest Method
  <a class="anchor" href="#random-forest-method">#</a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.ibm.com/content/dam/connectedassets-adobe-cms/worldwide-content/cdp/cf/ul/g/50/f9/ICLH_Diagram_Batch_03_27-RandomForest.component.xl.ts=1679336476850.png/content/adobe-cms/us/en/topics/random-forest/jcr:content/root/table_of_contents/body/content_section_styled/content-section-body/simple_narrative0/image" alt="Random Forest" /></p>
<p>The random forest algorithm is an extension of the bagging method as it utilizes both bagging and feature randomness to create an uncorrelated forest of decision trees.</p>
<p><strong>Applications :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finance :</strong> Preferred algo over others as it reduces time spent on data management and pre-processing tasks. It can be used to evaluate customers with high credit risk, fraud detection and option pricing problems.</li>
<li>Gene expression classification, biomarker discovery, sequence annotation, estimating drug responses to specific medications.</li>
<li><strong>E-commerce :</strong> It can be used for recommendation engines for cross-sell purposes.</li>
